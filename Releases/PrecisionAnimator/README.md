You know you want that cool, piloted drone camera view in your awesome game footage video.  
Using a cinematic mod on your game such as http://cinetools.xyz/games/ and this script while you play LIVE with keyboard and mouse,  
 you can get that cool look without having to use 4 hands to do 2 different things :)  

Originally made for Mirror's Edge: Catalyst cinematics, this script is great for any cinematic adventures of yours,  
 where you need to hold a VERY steady position on the stick to turn the camera VERY cinematically smooth.  

What this script does is what I've called "Active Stick Positioning".  
First you save the stick position you are currently holding on the controller,  
Second, when you are ready to use it, enable the positioning and this script will keep sending that exact saved stick position to the console,  
 allowing you to hold a VERY steady camera view effortlessly.  

This concept also works well in Angry Birds: Star Wars, for consistently holding the exact same aim trajectory every time effortlessly.  

Try this script out in any game you choose, I'm curious to see what games this ends up getting used for :D
