new for 3.1

Additions:
* 2nd activation axis. 
== By default it will now sense X axis along with the usual Y axis. 
== Both axises need to be idle for script actions to activate. Movement on either axis beyond deadzone stops script actions.
* A 2nd button can now also be held down.
* Configurable strength of held down button(s).
* Configuration Controls Updates:
== Moved misc script controls to Right stick/R3. (R3 = Enable, R3+RS Up = Enable Rumble, R3+RS Down = Enable LED)
== Added in-game ability to select nearly any Button/axis in-game and bind it to button #1 / #2 to Press, or Axis #1 / #2 to hold. (Select + [] to select button ID, Select + L1/R1 for binding)
== Updated Wait Time adjustment (Select + Up/Down). You can now hold Up to set wait time to 250ms; Down to set wait time to 20, rest time to 25.
* Presets Updates:
== Added 2 Games.
== Removed presets for games in which servers have closed, and an untested preset.
* Related documentation, variable names, and customzation area updates.

Fixes: 
- Start preset listened to the wrong button to activate.
- Saved 9 bytes by updating process for detecting if controller is idle.
- some compile fixes for Zen (PS4_TOUCHX depreciated)



Known issues:
- Zen: recommended to use duint8 instead of depreciated dbyte. CM+ however does not support "duint8" and instead uses dbyte. Rock and hard place.
- Touchpad / Sixaxis activationAxis is setup to still only listen to X axis. Y axis remains on stick if mode selected. (I deemed it not worth the extra bytes to add Y axis support for this unless needed.)
