### Inversion

###### 2.8 (1/18/21)
Additions:
- Improved upon Profiles setup:
   - Added Trigger Keys to activate either Profile #1 or Profile #2
   - Added optional Axis Check, useful for games where Trigger Key used does multiple actions that all do not require the same inversion setting.
   - Added Profile Sets feature.
   - Added 2 pre-programmed Profile Sets: Set #2 passes through or inverts Right Stick. Set #3 passes through or swaps A/X for RT/LT. (Set #1 is user saved settings in device.)
- You can now disable Rumble confirmation when Profile is switched ingame.
- Documentation Updates. 

###### 2.7 (10/28/20)
Added: 
- Axis travel Limiter. A specified Button or Axis can be set to output up to a certain axis travel range, useful for pressure-sensitive button games to ensure a light button tap is used or for racing games to limit the amount of throttle used.

###### 2.4 (9/22/18)
