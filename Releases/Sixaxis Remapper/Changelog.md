### Sixaxis Remapper

###### 2.3 (5/8/20)
- Sixaxis to Stick: Upgrade axis default inversion logic. 
	- In relation to sticks: PS3 / Wii controllers use normal Sixaxis Y, PS4 does not. Wii IR uses inverted X, Sixaxis/Touchpad does not.
- Documentation Updates

###### 2.2 (5/4/20)
Additions: 
- Ported edited script version from forums that combined the Stick and Sixaxis inputs from the controller. Thanks forum posters! Use Select + [] to enable/disable.
- Split script enable into separate enables for Y and X axis. Use Select + /\ to Enable/Disable Y axis; Select + () to Enable/Disable X axis
- Stick to Sixaxis: Added toggle to send (or not) original input axis to console.
Fixes:
- Added 100/-100 limiter. (CM seems to invert sent inputs if values are \>= 101/-101)

###### 2.1 (4/30/20)
- Integrated "reverse" version: You can now use Sixaxis (or Wii IR/PS4 Touchpad) to remap to a thumbstick! This mode is activated by default if using an Xbox. Use Select + Cross / A to switch between Stick <\-> Sixaxis remap modes.

###### 2.0 (10/8/16)
Changelog not found.
Only had mode "1" - thumbstick to Sixaxis.
