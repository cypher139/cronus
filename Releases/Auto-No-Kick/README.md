- Author: CypherNova139		
- Console: All
- Controller: All
- Script Usage: Anti-Idle / Task Automation


Do you need to grind items and/or you need to idle in an online multiplayer session - whether going afk unexpectedly, or using a 2nd system to idle in a boosting match just to fill lobby?

If or when your controller is left idle, Auto-No-Kick automatically activates set Anti-Idle Actions, performing various actions to help protect against game anti-idle features.
Auto-No-Kick automatically deactivates once the controller is back in use, and will automatically reactivate when the controller is left idle once more.

This allows you to avoid the dreaded multiplayer inactivity timeout while having to perform another task, or perform tedious item or XP grinds where you periodically need to press the same button over and over again without your intervention.

If both axises set to listen for (default: Left stick) are below the deadzone the controller is "Idle" and Auto-No-Kick automatically activates.
If the controller is in use the Anti-Idle Actions are deactivated (Deactivates when an axis is above deadzone) until the controller is left idle.

Actions While controller is "Idle":
- Presses Up To Two buttons of your choice every 1-31 seconds.
- Adjustable time taken between automated button presses (between 1-31 seconds).
- Hold Up To Two Buttons down when idle. \[2nd button added in 3.1\]
- Hold a button down for a timed interval when idle.
- Hold Up To Two axises in a pre-configured direction when idle.
- Have your character take a step forward, backward, then left, right every few cycle iterations.

Other Script Features:
- User Configuration while In-Game: Hold Select to access.
- Presets for use in Selected Games. Hold Select+L2 and press the associated preset button to activate.

- (Optional) LEDs notify you on Auto-No-Kick's current status.
- (Optional) Use Sixaxis X axis to detect if controller is in use (Hold controller sideways = In Use)
- (Optional) Use Touchpad X axis to detect if controller is in use (Press touchpad near edges = In Use, Press in center = Idle)
- (Optional) Disable script temporarily, for reasons?
- (Optional) Adjust strength of held down button(s). \[NEW for 3.1\]
