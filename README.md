## Archived
[LittleBigPlanet - Automated Crowd Pleaser trophy](Archived/LittleBigPlanet%20-%20Automated%20Crowd%20Pleaser%20trophy.gpc) | *LittleBigPlanet 1 only: Automate Crowd Pleaser trophy (get 50 plays on your level) by replaying someone's level over and over again.*
*Only works on LBP1 - newer games require unique players.
* Unusable as-is due to server closure.* 
[ModNation Racers Creation Downloader](Archived/ModNation%20Racers%20Creation%20Downloader.gpc) | *ModNation Racers: Automate downloading of all items in your favorites list in Download 4 Download boosting.*
*This was done to get the insane 250,000 Create XP for the Star Creator trophy. You get 100xp from each download, 20xp from each view. This amounts to around 2,200 downloads needed, hence many trophy hunters had 'boosting' areas where I download yours and you download mine (Download 4 Download).*
*But there is no "Download all" button ingame, each download is done individually. ~7-8 hours later and you can enumerate through everyone's downloads. It was a time consuming mess, hence why I automated the process via this script, allowing it to be run while I slept lol.*
* Unusable as-is due to server closure.*
