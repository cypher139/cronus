Sometimes my mind doesn't understand the game's camera controls, depending on the type of camera view (1st/3rd person) I'm currently viewing, so I ended up creating this handy script!  
  
"Inversion" allows you to change to normal or inverted camera controls at any time, without having to use the game's options menus, allowing for quick changes of camera controls to your preference.

		  How To Use  
\\\\\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-//  
  
Basics:  
Use the configuration options ingame by holding Select(PS3) / Share(PS4) / Back(360) / View(XB1) / \-(Wii) on your controller and pressing the desired option button.   
(Available options detailed in Controls section)  
Once your options are selected release the Select button.  
  
Now you're ready to play ingame with your selected inversion and/or button swap settings activated.  
  
To save settings that you frequently use to be enabled upon script startup, check the Defaults section below for options to configure.  
  
Advanced:  
For more advanced usage, try the Profiles feature which allows you to switch between saved inversion settings while still remaining in the game.  
This is useful for quick inversion changes as needed to sync your mind and controls with recent ingame actions.  
  
2 profiles can be saved to the device internal memory, or use other Profile Sets pre provided.  
  
Check the Controls and Defaults sections for more explanations of all available features.
